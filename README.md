Further details about the app can be found on the play store link.

Few noteworthy features -
  - Poink works to detect when the user is falling asleep and alerts them, this is unlike the other typical "keep-me-awake" apps where the user has to keep telling the phone that he/she is awake
  - Can detect the user falling asleep even when the phone screen is off
  - Sleep-detection can run in the background and users can continue doing other things on their phones
  - If a call comes in when Poink is activated, sleep-detection is paused for the duration of the call
  - Alerting starts with vibration and then an ascending ringtone (to especially help lactating mothers wake up without waking up their baby)
  - uses the same 3-circle animation to indicate - off,on and alerting states.Circle-can also be flicked up to stop sleep-detection
  - Adjustable tilt-angle settings and vibration-duration
