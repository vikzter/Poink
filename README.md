Few noteworthy features -
  -- Phone works to detect when the user is falling asleep and alert them, unlike other typical keep-me-awake apps where user has to keep telling the phone that he/she is awake
  -- Can detect the user falling asleep even when the phone screen is off
  -- User can activate Poink and sleep-detection runs in the background while user can continue doing other things on the phone
  -- If a call comes in when Poink is activated, sleep-detection is paused for the duration of the call
  -- Alerting starts with vibration and then an ascending ringtone (to help lactating mothers wakeup without waking up the baby)
  -- uses the same 3-circle animation to indicate - off,on and alerting states.Circle-can also be flicked up to stop sleep-detection
  -- Adjustable tilt-angle settings and vibration-duration
